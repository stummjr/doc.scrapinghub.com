Scrapinghub Documentation
=========================

Scrapinghub is the most advanced platform for deploying and running web crawlers (also known as *spiders* or *scrapers*). It allows you to build crawlers easily, deploy them instantly and scale them on demand, without having to manage servers, backups or cron jobs. Everything is stored in a highly available database and retrievable using an API.

Spiders can be written in Python using `Scrapy`_, built visually using `Portia`_ tool or both. Spiders are grouped into projects. Each spider run is known as a *job*.

Here you will find reference documentation. For more articles, guides and other help resources please visit our `Knowledge Base`_ in our `Support center`_.
